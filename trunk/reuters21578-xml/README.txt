This directory contains an "XMLised" version of David Lewis'
distribution of the original Reuters News Corpus for Text
Classification (Reuters-21578). Files reut2-001.xml, ...,
reut2-021.xml contain about 26Mb of well-formed (but not valid)
XML-encoded news items, each annotated with categories (see
cat-descriptions_120396.txt) and other information such as TITLE, and
BODY of text. The files can be easily parsed by any non-validating,
event-driven parser such as J. Clark's XP or any other SAX-conformant
parser.

More details in README_LEWIS.txt.
